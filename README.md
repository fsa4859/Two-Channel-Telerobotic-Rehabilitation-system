# Two-Channel-Telerobotic-Rehabilitation-System
Simulation of two channel telerobotic rehabilitation system in the presence of constant and variable communication delay. Smith Predictor and Wava Variables were designed and implemented to ensure the stability of the system in the presence of constant time delay. Passivation by scaling was used to ensure the system stability in the presence of variable time delay.
